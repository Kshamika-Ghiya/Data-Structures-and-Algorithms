# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! Here, I explore various data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques using Python.

## About

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are essential components of computer science and programming. This repository is dedicated to studying and implementing them in Python, aiming to improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## Contents

### 1. Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Implementation and manipulation of arrays in Python.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and their operations.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Basic implementations and applications.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal algorithms.
- **Graphs**: Graph representation and traversal algorithms.

### 2. Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation and analysis of various sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary search, linear search, and related techniques.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving optimization problems using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Solving problems by making locally optimal choices.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Graph traversal algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS), shortest path algorithms, and minimum spanning tree algorithms.
