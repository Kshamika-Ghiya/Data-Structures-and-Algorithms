# 10 Key Data Structures We Use Everyday    -ByteByteGo

## 1. LISTS
- Versatile and essential data structure.
- Great for storing or manipulating ordered data.
- Task Management System
  - Lists can be used to store and organize tasks for each user in a task management system.
  - Tasks can be added, removed, or reordered easily.
  - Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Social Media Application (eg. Twitter)
  - Lists can be used to store and display a users feed in real time.
-Shopping Carts

## 2. ARRAYS
- Fundamental data structure
- provides a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements.
- Suited in cases where the size of the collection is known or doesn't change frequently.
- Used in mathematical operations, storing large data sets, or when there is a need for random access to elements.
- Weather Applications
  - Arrays can be used to store temperature readings for a specific location over a defined period.
  - Allows for easy calculations like averages and trends.
- Image Processing
  - Widely used where each pixel data is represented in a 2D array.
  - Enables efficient manipulation and transformation of the image.

## 3. STACKS
- Follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- Perfect for supporting undo and redo operations.
- Text Editor
  - Used to store each change made to the text,
  - This makes it easier to return to a previous state when an undo operation is triggered by the user.
- Maintaining browser history in web browsers.

## 4. QUEUES
- Operates on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis.
- Good for managing printer jobs and sending user action in games.
- Chat Applications
  - Used to store incoming messages in the order they are received.
  - Ensures that the display to the recipient is in the correct sequence.

## 5. HEAPS
- Used for task scheduling and memory management.
- Helpful in implementing priority queues where we need to access the highest or lowest priority item efficiently.

## 6. TRESS
- Helps organize data hierarchically.
- Useful for representing data with natural hierarchies or relationships.
- AI decision-making
  - Decision trees are used in Machine Learning for classification tasks.
- Database Indexing
  - Helps speed up search, insert, or delete operations.
  - B-trees and B+trees are commonly used in relational databases to efficiently manage and index large amounts of data.
    
## 7. HASH TABLES
- Allows for efficient data lookup, insertion, and deletion.
- Use hash functions to map keys to their corresponding storage locations.
- Enables constant time access to the stored values.
- Search Engines
  - Used to store and quickly retrieve indexed data based on keywords.
  - Provides fast and relevant search results.
- Caching Systems
  - Store and manage cached data.
  - Allows for rapid access to frequently requested resources and improves overall system performance.
- Programming Language Interpreters / Compilers
  - Used for implementation of symbol tables.
  - Used to efficiently manage and look up variables, functions, and other symbols defined in the source code.
 
## 8. SUFFIX TREES
- Specialized for searching strings in documents.
- Search Engine
  - Used to efficiently locate all occurrences of search terms within a large corpus of data.
- Text Editor
- Search Algorithms 

## 9. GRAPHS
- All about tracking relationships or finding paths.
- Invaluable in social networks, recommendation engines, and path-finding algorithms.
- Social Network
  - Used to represent the connections between users.
  - Enables features like friend suggestions or analyzing network trends.

## 10. R-TREES
- Good at finding nearest neighbors.
- Crucial for mapping apps and geolocation services.
- Mapping Applications
  - Used to store spacial data, such as points of interest.
  - Enable efficient queries to find the nearest locations based on the users current position.
